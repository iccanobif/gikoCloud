- ConnectionWrapper::onerror() should make the entire process close
- gikocloud.js should restart the backend process when it dies
- just concatenate a series of QStrings and then conver them to constData, no need to use sprintf()
- std::map<quint32, QString> playerNames should be a map from playerId to objects of a class PlayerInfo 
  keeping track of both their name and position (x, y)
- Remove the enums like CPSharedObject::Character?
